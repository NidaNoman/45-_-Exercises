// Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer 
// and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required
//  information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned 
//  to make sure all the information was stored correctly.

function storecarinfo(manufacturer:string,modelname:string, ...extraoption:{[key:string ] :any}[]):
object {
    const carinfo ={
        manufacturer,
        modelname,
        ...Object.assign({}, ...extraoption)

    }
    return carinfo

};
let answer =  storecarinfo("honda", "civic", {color: "black"}, {features : ["navigation", "power window"]})
console.log(answer);
